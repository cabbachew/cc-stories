  backgroundBlurb:
    "As a freshman at San Mateo High School with exceptional aptitude for physics and mathematics, Yoav sought guidance to transform his theoretical interests into a substantive project. Despite having improved his executive function skills, he needed structure to navigate the often tedious preliminary work required before reaching the 'amazing part' of physics research. Yoav approached the mentorship with clear goals: finding a specific area of interest to master, developing persistence through challenging material, and creating a real physics project. With aspirations for a future in theoretical physics research, he was looking for a mentor who could match both his intellectual rigor and his distinctive sense of humor.",
