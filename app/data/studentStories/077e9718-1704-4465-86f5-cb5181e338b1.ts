  backgroundBlurb:
    "Ancel entered eighth grade at a new, more rigorous school where he encountered higher academic expectations that required adjustment. Despite being naturally bright, social, and charismatic, he needed support in developing stronger work habits and academic confidence, particularly in humanities subjects. With a tendency to classify himself as 'good' or 'bad' at different skills rather than seeing learning as a process, Ancel sought mentorship that would provide both structure and intellectual engagement to help him reach his considerable potential.",
