  backgroundBlurb:
    "Drew began his mentorship journey as a naturally gifted young mathematician with an insatiable hunger for knowledge that often outpaced the structured learning environment of his school. Despite his exceptional memory and ability to sit for hours solving complex problems, Drew struggled with translating his grand ideas into executable steps due to gaps in his executive functioning skills. He was seeking not just to learn algebra, but to understand how it connected to the quantum physics concepts that fascinated him. Drew needed a mentor who could match his intellectual intensity while providing the framework to channel his scattered brilliance, someone who could help him find pathways to apply his mathematical abilities in meaningful ways while building the skills to bring his ambitious ideas to fruition.",
