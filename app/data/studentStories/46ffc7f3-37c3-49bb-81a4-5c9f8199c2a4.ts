  backgroundBlurb:
    "Drake began his mentorship journey with a desire to excel in Advanced Math and an interest in creating a comic book or manga. As an avid manga reader who would read his favorites hundreds of times, he had the passion but needed guidance on the creative process. While initially focused on academic goals, Drake's natural creativity flourished when his project evolved from a simple comic book concept into a sophisticated board game design with complex character abilities and gameplay mechanics.",
