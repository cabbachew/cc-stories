  backgroundBlurb:
    "Emma began her mentorship with a strong foundation in food advocacy through her work with Backpack Buddies and her school's Food Critics Club. While passionate about addressing food insecurity, she needed guidance to transform her varied interests and activities into a cohesive project with real-world impact. With experience in both storytelling and health advocacy but unsure how to effectively combine them, Emma sought to create a platform that would showcase her commitment to food justice while helping her stand out in future academic pursuits. Together with Claire, whose background in Human Biology with a focus on nutritional psychiatry provided perfect complementary expertise, Emma set out to develop a multimedia project that would raise awareness about food insecurity while providing practical resources to her community.",
