  backgroundBlurb:
    "Caris came to Curious Cardinals as a high-achieving ninth grader at The Chapin School with strong academic performance but seeking to build confidence in her abilities. While tenacious and socially adept, she was often self-critical and compared herself to her twin brother. As a co-founder of Track Tutoring alongside peers Spencer and Penelope, Caris sought mentorship to develop entrepreneurial skills and business acumen. She needed a mentor who could provide practical guidance on growing their tutoring platform while helping her develop the confidence to assert her ideas and contributions in a collaborative business environment.",
