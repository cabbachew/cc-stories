  backgroundBlurb:
    "Sloane came to Curious Cardinals as a rising 9th grader with a budding passion for astronomy and an impressive array of interests spanning national-level volleyball, part-time modeling, and science communication. While academically accomplished, she sought guidance to develop her astronomy research project and prepare for a presentation at the American Astronomical Society meeting. Living in NYC limited her stargazing opportunities, but summers in Nantucket and connections with NSF research fellows gave her glimpses into the research world she was eager to explore more deeply. Sloane sought mentorship to channel her enthusiasm into a focused research project that could showcase her potential while developing practical skills in space science and engineering.",
