  backgroundBlurb:
    "Avery came to Curious Cardinals as a confident, outgoing 10th grader who excelled academically but sought to discover deeper passions and carve her own path.

As a natural connector with remarkable social skills, Avery wanted to pursue something meaningful that could impact her community. She needed a mentor who could help her explore the intersection of her various interests while providing the structure and guidance to transform ideas into concrete action.",
