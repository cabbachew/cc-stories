  backgroundBlurb:
    "When Pia began working with Ellie, she sought to develop a meaningful extracurricular project that would showcase her passion for medicine while making a tangible impact. As a homeschooled eleventh grader with aspirations toward a surgical career, Pia wanted to create something substantial that would both demonstrate her commitment to medicine and help others. Despite being a world-class competitive fencer with significant time constraints, Pia was determined to challenge herself by building a comprehensive website about single ventricle defectsâ€”a project that would require extensive research, organization, and technical skills she had not yet developed. She needed a mentor who could provide clear direction on the project structure while understanding her perfectionist tendencies and sensitivity to critique.",
