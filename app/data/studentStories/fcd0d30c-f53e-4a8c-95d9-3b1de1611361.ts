  backgroundBlurb:
    "Jake, a driven 11th grader at Riverdale, sought mentorship to develop his sustainability passion project. As the leader of his school's sustainability club with a strong STEM background, Jake had already built a hydroponic system but needed guidance to transform his technical knowledge into an educational curriculum. He was looking for a mentor who could provide structure for developing website content and a 5-session curriculum to teach younger students about sustainability, while offering subject matter expertise in plant biology to enhance the scientific foundation of his lessons.",
