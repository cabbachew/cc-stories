  backgroundBlurb:
    "Shaw came to Curious Cardinals as an athletically-inclined 8th grader with a natural curiosity about sports medicine, sparked by his own diagnosis with juvenile arthritis. Though excelling in sports like basketball and soccer, he sought a deeper understanding of medicine, particularly conditions affecting young athletes. Shaw wasn't interested in passive learning, instead preferring hands-on projects with real-world applications. He needed a mentor who could balance scientific rigor with engaging, interactive lessons while connecting abstract medical concepts to his athletic experiences.",
